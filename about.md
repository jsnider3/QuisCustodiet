I'm a computer scientist, a true believer in the 
glory of the technocracy, and a George Mason MS CS student.

My interests as a computer scientist are machine 
learning, AI, computer vision, comparative programming 
languages, and compilers/interpreters.

I can be reached either through the email at the bottom
of the page, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-snider/5a/482/6ba) page, or leaving a comment.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy biking and karaoke. 
Further information is not available here.
